drupal_domo
===========

Drupal base theme built with [DOMO](https://github.com/koycarraway/domo/)

One odd thing. We've placed all npm files inside a folder named .npm because
Drupal would try to scan node_modules for .info files. This was bad. So we
moved it.

## Instructions
Take this theme and rename it for your own needs.

Run the following commands from the .npm folder:

1. ```$ npm install```
2. ```$ bower install```

Start gulping.
